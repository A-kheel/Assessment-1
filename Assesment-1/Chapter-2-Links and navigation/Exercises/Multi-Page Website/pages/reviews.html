"Do you want to drive realistically and almost like in real life? Then Euro Truck Simulator 2 is the kind of game you should try, a very large world that benefits from almost all countries. In addition, this game offers a variety of trucks and really good tuning options, and that's not all, plus you can find and use thousands of mods that make the game even more fun. And you think that's the end? No. You can also play with others or friends in convoy mode or in the additional multiplayer called “TruckersMP”. That's not all, ever heard of ProMods? OK, if not then I'll explain it here: ProMods is a mod extension that adds more countries that aren't available as DLC, as well as better graphics, but that's a matter of perspective. You can use Euro Truck Simulator with steering wheel & all other accessories. In my opinion an absolute game changer & for me one of the best games. I hope I could give you an insight, what are you waiting for, become the trucker of your own fantasy"</p>

<p>"The five new countries featured here are all quite beautiful, and offer a vast new road network to explore. This is bound to keep you trucking for hours as you explore every nook and cranny."

<h2>From a Reddit user</h2>
<p>" I bought Euro Truck Simulator 2 at the end of November (the essentials pack with Scandinavia and Going East DLC) and have sunk just over 50 hours into it since then; I've told a few people what I'm playing and have had some raised eyebrows and smiles but I'm really enjoying the experience, slowly increasing my cash, acquiring a decent Scania truck and getting enough money to buy a garage and hire a driver to work for me. The graphics are pretty good, not quite AAA but really solid for a simulator and the trucks look great. The AI of the other cars is sometimes lacking, they do dumb things quite often... but that probably makes it more realistic!

I bought the Vive La France DLC at the weekend and downloaded Promods, which massively expands the map (though was a bit of a pain to download (they say it's free but once you register they try to make you pay to download it by making the free version harder to download). I had avidly watched Squirrel on youtube driving the Promods map of Iceland though, so I REALLY wanted it. I've not really been able to try much of it yet but the quality of the maps looks excellent.
